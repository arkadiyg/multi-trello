# Multi Trello

Multi Trello is a basic tool that provides an overview of cards across multiple trello boards where you use consistent column names.

It provides filters for ownership and column names.

## Setup

1. To set the tool up open the index.html file and replace YOUR_TRELLO_API_KEY at the very bottom with your Trello api key.
To generate or find your Trello api key login to Trello and go here: https://trello.com/app-key
It should be pretty simple!
For more help see the docs: https://developers.trello.com/ and this Trello card: https://trello.com/c/jObnWvl1/25-generating-your-developer-key

2. Next you'll want to edit the listname dropdown to use the Trello column headers that you use across multiple boards. Those are in the index.php file as a simple select element. We have our scrum statuses such as 'To Do' and 'In Progress'. 

3. Lastly, visit the page in your browser and click the 'Log In' button at top. You'll get a popup to authorize access and you should be set.

## By the way
The bootstrap and moustache versions used here are pretty stale. Feel free to fork and upgrade or improve.
